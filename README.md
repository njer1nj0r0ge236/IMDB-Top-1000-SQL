# IMDB-Top-1000-SQL
# IMDb Analysis with SQL

**Day 2 of the #22in7 Data Challenge**

This project contains a series of SQL queries exploring the [IMDb Top 1000 Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/octopusteam/imdb-top-1000-movies/data) dataset. Using SQL Server, I analyzed various aspects of the dataset, including top-rated movies, vote distributions, genre trends by decade, hidden gems, and more.

## Overview

As part of my 7-day consistency challenge (#22in7), I decided to dive into the IMDb Top 1000 Movies dataset using SQL Server. This project highlights insights such as:
- Top movies by rating and votes
- Genre trends across decades
- Hidden gems that are highly rated but have relatively few votes
- How vote count correlates (or doesnâ€™t) with ratings

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains the following columns:
- `id`: IMDb ID  
- `title`: Movie Title  
- `genres`: Movie Genres (comma-separated)  
- `averageRating`: Average Rating  
- `numVotes`: Number of Votes  
- `releaseYear`: Year of Release

> **Note:** Before importing, the CSV file was cleaned to ensure proper formatting and to avoid issues with text truncation.
